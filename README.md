# Cooksys Final App

This project is a full stack application incorporating the Angular framework for Front-end and Spring Boot for backend. I was a part of the front-end team and individually responsible for the 'login' and 'user-registry' pages. As a group, we worked in an Agile Kanban style environment and utilized the Github issues and project board.

This project had 3 primary objectives:
1. Project Planning: Given the Figma wireframe and ERD, our group documented the necessary endpoints and illustrated them on the Github Wiki. We also divided the project into manageable sections, assigning each member specific tasks to work on
2. Code: The front end team collaborated closely with the backend team to create a Full-Stack Web Application from scratch 
3. Presentation: Our group conducted a presentation where we demonstrated the application, highlighting its key features, to the lead developers
